# Python Homework â„–2

This repository contains solutions to the second homework assignment, which consists of three programming tasks written in Python. All tasks are located in separate files.

**Note**: The common goal for all tasks was to avoid using built-in functions, libraries, or any external tools. The solutions were implemented solely with basic Python constructs.

## [Task 1: Split List into Two Parts](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/blob/main/HW_2/Task_01.py)
The program defines a function that splits a given list into two parts. The first part contains all but the last `n` elements, and the second part contains the last `n` elements, where `n` is half the size of the list.

- **Input**: A list of elements.
- **Output**: Two lists, the first containing the larger half of the original list and the second containing the smaller half.

## [Task 2: Remove Non-Unique Elements](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/blob/main/HW_2/Task_02.py)
This program defines a function that removes all non-repeating elements from a list, leaving only the duplicate values.

- **Input**: A list of elements.
- **Output**: A list containing only the elements that appear more than once in the original list.

## [Task 3: Search for Missing Element in Arithmetic Progression](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/blob/main/HW_2/Task_03.py)
The program defines a function that finds a missing element in a sequence of numbers that follow an arithmetic progression. The list provided is unsorted, and the missing element is calculated based on the sum of the elements in the progression.

- **Input**: A list of numbers following an arithmetic progression with one missing element.
- **Output**: The missing element in the progression.
