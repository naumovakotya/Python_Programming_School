**[Certificate of Completion from Python Programming Online School at Coherent solutions](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/blob/main/Naumova_Ekaterina_Coherent_solutions.pdf)**

## Projects Overview

### [Homework 1: Basic Python Tasks](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/tree/main/HW_1)
**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Data manipulation and basic Python logic
- Looping structures and condition handling
- Error handling and user input validation

This task involved solving simple problems using Python, such as finding the largest digit in a number, calculating ISBN check digits, and converting integers to binary. These tasks provided hands-on experience with loops, conditions, and basic input/output handling.

### [Homework 2: List Operations](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/tree/main/HW_2)
**Skills Demonstrated**:
- List manipulation and splitting
- Removing non-unique elements from lists
- Algorithmic thinking with missing element search in sequences

This task involved more advanced operations with lists, including splitting lists into two parts, removing non-unique elements, and finding missing elements in arithmetic progressions.

### [Homework 3: Text Compression and JSON Manipulation](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/tree/main/HW_3)
**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Text processing and manipulation
- Basic file I/O and CSV operations
- JSON sorting and grouping

In this homework, I worked on text compression by analyzing word frequencies and sorting JSON data based on different parameters. This task provided a deeper understanding of working with files and data structures like dictionaries and lists in Python.

### [Homework 4: Battle Game Simulation](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/tree/main/HW_4)
**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading
- Implementing game mechanics with classes

This task involved building a battle game simulation using OOP principles. I created classes for different types of warriors (e.g., `Warrior`, `Knight`, `Defender`, `Vampire`) and armies, then implemented a battle system with fuel-efficient battle logging.

### [Final Task: Fuel-Efficient Route Finder](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/tree/main/HW_Final_task)
**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Pathfinding algorithms and road network optimization
- Handling complex input data (CSV) with multiple restrictions
- Advanced algorithm development (custom pathfinding algorithm)
- File I/O and vehicle management

In the final task, I developed an algorithm to find the most fuel-efficient route between cities based on road complexities and vehicle restrictions. The solution handles multiple intermediate points, fuel consumption calculations, and prohibited routes for certain vehicles.

## General Skills Gained
- Proficiency in Python programming for real-world problem-solving
- Understanding of algorithm development and optimization techniques
- Experience with data manipulation (CSV, JSON)
- Object-oriented programming and software design
- Problem-solving using advanced algorithms like Dijkstra's variant for pathfinding

## Conclusion
These projects reflect my ability to approach various types of problems, from basic programming logic to more advanced topics like algorithmic optimization and object-oriented design. Each task has helped me improve my programming skills and deepen my understanding of data science concepts. Feel free to explore each folder for more details about the specific tasks and solutions.

## Conclusion
These projects demonstrate my programming abilities, particularly in Python, and showcase my growth in problem-solving and algorithm development. Each task has allowed me to build stronger programming skills and apply them to diverse problem sets.
