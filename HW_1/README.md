# Python Homework â„–1

This repository contains solutions to the first homework assignment, which consists of three programming tasks written in Python. All tasks are located in the `HW_1` folder, with each task implemented in a separate file.

## [Task 1: Largest Digit Finder](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/blob/main/HW_1/Task_01.py)
The program prompts the user to input a natural number less than 1,000,000,000. If the input is valid (i.e., a number in the specified range), the program calculates and prints the largest digit of the entered number. If the input is invalid (either not a number or outside the range), the program displays an error message.

- **Input**: A natural number less than 1,000,000,000.
- **Output**: The largest digit of the entered number or an error message for invalid input.

## [Task 2: ISBN-10 Check Digit Calculator](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/blob/main/HW_1/Task_02.py)
The program asks the user to input the first 9 digits of an ISBN-10 number. It then calculates the 10th digit (the check digit) using the appropriate formula. If the calculated check digit is 10, it is represented by 'X'. The program then prints the complete 10-digit ISBN. If the input is invalid (not a 9-digit integer), an error message is displayed.

- **Input**: The first 9 digits of an ISBN-10 number.
- **Output**: The complete 10-digit ISBN or an error message for invalid input.

## [Task 3: Binary Representation and Count of Ones](https://github.com/naumovakotya/Python_Programming_School/blob/main/HW_1/Task_03.py)
This program asks the user to input an integer number. It then calculates and prints the binary representation of the number, as well as the count of 'ones' in that binary representation. If the input is invalid (not an integer), the program displays an error message.

- **Input**: An integer number.
- **Output**: The binary representation of the number and the count of 'ones', or an error message for invalid input.
